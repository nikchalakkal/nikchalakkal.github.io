## Welcome to my GitHub

### Who am I?

I am an business manager, with 9 years of post MBA experience in Supply Chain Management who is currently pursuing a Masters degree in Business Analytics (MSBA) at Emory University's Goizueta Business School, expecting to graduate in May'18. This is my second Masters' Degree, having completed my MBA from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA) in 2008, after graduating as a Chemical Engineer in 2006.

### What am I currently learning?

My course at Goizueta covers subjects dealing with Business Analytics (Machine Learning, Managing Big Data, Data Visualization), Techniques for Data Manipulation (Classification, Regression, and more), and uses multiple programming languages (R, Python, SQL) and tools (Tableau, RapidMiner, Jupyter, and more).

### What do I already know?

In the domain of SCM, I have expertise in Supply Network Planning, Operations Management, Process Design, Service Recovery Management, Warehouse Strategy and Design, KPI Definition, Inventory Planning and more. I have working in Consulting, Operations, Planning & Strategy, have significant experience in the Apparel and Online Retail Sectors, and have also done multiple projects in FMCG, Beverages, Pharma, Auto Spare Parts, Commodities and 3PL Strategy.

### Why a Masters Degree now?

Looking for more efficient ways to do something has been a constant driver in my life, be in at home, in school, or at work. I have learnt the value of having hard data to make judgments and inferences, as I have grown in my career, and wanted to add data management and manipulation skills to my portfolio, so I could better use data to figure out better, more efficient ways of getting business critical insights. 

### What else?

I am a quick learner who tries to imbibe best practices from all the organizations I interact with, and am capable of delivering excellent performance and consistently accurate results under pressure over long periods. In my spare time, I like to read - I spend a lot of time reading online. I have a head for really irrelevant trivia, and love making (bad) puns and playing word games.
