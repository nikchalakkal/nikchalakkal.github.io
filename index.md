## Welcome to my GitHub

### Who am I?

I am an business manager, with 9 years of post MBA experience in **_Supply Chain Management_** who is currently pursuing a Masters degree in **_Business Analytics (MSBA)_** at **_Emory University's Goizueta Business School_**, expecting to graduate in May'18. This is my second Masters' Degree, having completed my MBA from the **_Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA)_** in 2008, after graduating as a Chemical Engineer in 2006.

### What's this Git about?

My course at Goizueta covers subjects dealing with **_Data Analytics_** (Machine Learning, Managing Big Data, Social Networks, Data Visualization and others) **_Analytics Techniques_** (Classification, Regression and more), and uses multiple **_Programming Languages_** (R, Python, SQL and others) and **_Analytics Tools_** (Tableau, RapidMiner, and more). This GitHub is just a collection of my random (and not so random) attempts to create something meaningful - through code and other means - out of nothing :)

### What do I already know?

In Supply Chain, I have working in **_Consulting, Operations, Planning & Strategy_**, doing Supply Network Planning, Operations Management, Process Design, Service Recovery Management, Warehouse Strategy and Design, KPI Definition, Inventory Planning and more. I have significant experience in the **_Retail Industry_** - both Offline (in Apparel) and Online Retail, and apart from these, have also done projects in FMCG, Beverages, Pharma, Auto Spare Parts, Commodities and 3PL Strategy.

### Why a Masters Degree now?

Looking for more efficient ways to do something has been a constant driver in my life, be it at home (my wife does get bugged at times!), in school, or at work. As I have grown in my career, I have learnt the value of having hard data to make judgments and inferences, and realized that I needed to add data management and manipulation skills to my portfolio to figure out better, more efficient ways of getting insights. 

### What else?

I'm a little bit of a geek, but also a quick learner who tries to imbibe best practices from all the organizations I interact with. I am high functioning and capable of delivering consistently accurate results over long periods under pressure. In my spare time, I like to read - I spend a lot of time reading online. I have a head for really irrelevant trivia, and love making (bad) puns and playing word games.
