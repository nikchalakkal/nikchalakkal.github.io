### What's this Git about?

I am currently pursuing a Masters degree: **_MS in Business Analytics (MSBA)_** from Goizueta Business School, Emory University. My course covers topics in **_Data Analytics_** (Machine Learning, Managing Big Data, Social Networks, Data Visualization and others), teaching us various **_Analytics Techniques_** (Classification, Regression and more) using multiple **_Programming Languages_** (R, Python, SQL and others) and **_Analytics Tools_** (Tableau, RapidMiner, and more).   

This GitHub is just a collection of my random (and not so random) attempts to create something meaningful - through coding and other stuff that I'm learning - out of nothing :)

### That's... somewhat interesting, I guess. But why Analytics? What's your background?

I'm a business manager with 9 years of post MBA experience in **_Supply Chain Management_**. I have done **_Supply Chain Consulting_**, and also have experience in **_Planning, Strategy & Operations Management_** in the Retail industry (both Brick & Mortar and Online Retail).   

Apart from the Retail industry, I have also worked on projects in FMCG, Beverages, Pharma, Auto Spare Parts, Commodities and 3PL industries as a Consultant. These projects involved Process Design, Service Recovery Management, Warehouse Strategy and Design, KPI Definition, Inventory Planning and other aspects of SCM.

### That's a lot! Where all have you worked?

I have working with with **_[Flipkart](http://www.flipkart.com)_**, India's first and biggest online marketplace, and one of the world's most valuable startups, according to [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/graphics/billion-dollar-club/); with **_[Arvind Limited](http://arvind.com/)_**, the fourth largest producer and exporter of denim in the world; with **_[Miebach Consulting](http://www.miebach.com/en/)_**, a German Supply Chain Consulting Firm; and with the **_[Aditya Birla Group](http://www.adityabirla.com/home)_**, an Indian Multinational Conglomerate with operations in 40 countries.

### Why would you want to do a second Masters Degree?

Looking for more efficient ways to do something has been a constant driver in my life, be it at home (my wife does get bugged at times!), in school, or at work. As I have grown in my career, I have learnt the value of having hard data to make judgments and inferences, and realized that I needed to add data management and manipulation skills to my portfolio to figure out better, more efficient ways of getting insights. And studying further is always good :smile:

### "Studying is good"? Are you that much of a nerd?

Well, I guess I am a little bit of a geek (:grinning:), but only a little. I am also a quick learner who tries to imbibe best practices from all the organizations I interact with, high functioning and capable of delivering consistently accurate results over long periods under pressure. In my spare time, I like to read - I spend a lot of time reading online. The geeky parts of me - I have a head for really irrelevant trivia, and love making (bad) puns and playing word games.
